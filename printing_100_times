#method 1:
for i in range(101): #if 'i' is between 0 and 101 then the following program will run: 
    print ("I will not sleep in class")
    #This prints "I will not sleep in class" 100 times not 101 times because the 'range' function only counts until the number before it.

print("")

#Or you can use this method as well:
r = 0 #This sets r as 0 when the program starts
while r != 100: #sets a condition if r is not 100, the following program will run:
  print("Yes") 
  r += 1
  #This prints "Yes" 100x
